        """The gaussian mixture PHD filter for linear multi-target tracking.

        The gaussian mixture PHD filter is a multi target tracker for linear state space models.
        It can be regarded as an extension of the Kalman filter formulas to so-called random
        finite sets (RFS). The PHD filter follows the same prediction-correction scheme for state
        estimation as the single target Kalman filters. As an additional part of the interface,
        the internal model for the filter's belief needs to be pruned regularly as to limit
        the computational complexity. The extraction of a state estimate is similarly more
        sophisticated in the PHD filter and requires the use of a dedicated procedure.

        Examples:
            Start by importing the necessary numpy functions.

            >>> from numpy import array
            >>> from numpy import eye
            >>> from numpy import vstack

            Setup the model.
            In this case, we track 1D positions with constant velocities.
            Thereby we choose the transition model like so.

            >>> F = array([[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0]])

            The measurements will be positions and no velocities.

            >>> H = array([[1.0, 0.0]])

            Furthermore, we assume the following noise on the process and measurements.

            >>> Q = eye(2)
            >>> R = eye(1)

            Our belief of how targets are generetaded is for them to start with
            a position and velocity of 0.

            >>> mean = vstack([0.0, 0.0])
            >>> covariance = array([[1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0]])
            >>> birth_belief = [Gaussian(mean, covariance)]

            We need to tell the filter how certain we are to detect targets and whether they survive.
            Also, the amount of clutter in the observed environment is quantized.

            >>> survival_rate = 0.99
            >>> detection_rate = 0.99
            >>> intensity = 0.01

            Then, we initialize the filter. This model has not input, so we ignore B.

            >>> phd = GaussianMixturePHD(
            ...     birth_belief,
            ...     survival_rate,
            ...     detection_rate,
            ...     intensity,
            ...     F,
            ...     H,
            ...     Q,
            ...     R
            ... )

            We first predict with the provided model and then correct the prediction with a
            measurement of a single targets' position.

            >>> phd.predict()
            >>> phd.correct([array([5.])])
